This is my Travelling Salesman Algorithm repository. I created this project for my Data & Program Structures class at Kansas State University. 
The project showcases my understanding of Microsofts Visual Studio's GUI, MinPriorityQueues, the Travelling Salesman Algorithm, Object Oriented Programming, and many other programming topics. 
When ran, this project opens a window with a Drawing Canvas. You're able to click on the Drawing Canvas to create points on the plane.
After you've selected a few points on the Drawing Canvas, the Find Shortest Circuit button becomes clickable. Once clicked, it finds the shortest path to connect all of the points on the plane. 
Feel free to inspect my code and check it out!
